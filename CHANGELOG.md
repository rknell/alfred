## 1.1.0+2

- Testing and updating compatibility with dart 3.0.0

## 1.1.0+1

- Readme edit

## 1.1.0+0

- Small breaking change - when body parsing fails Alfred now throws a BodyParserException which can be caught and handled manually. This may affect you if you have a try catch block but expect it to not catch (which lets face it is unlikely!)

## 1.0.0+1

- Just a bump to update the readme

## 1.0.0

- Moving to dart v2.17.x (thanks @NathanDraco22)

## 0.1.7

- Updating the CORS headers to also allow Access-Control-Expose-Headers thanks @Donk3ys


## 0.1.6+1

## 0.1.5+3

- Fixing route handling if you have a parameter on the route. ie /:id

## 0.1.5+2

## 0.1.5+1

- Updating description to be easier to be found by pub.dev search

## 0.1.5

- Been a while since the last published update... lots of little changes but very few bugs. However thanks to @d-markey the routing logic has been completely rewritten though non api breaking, allowing far more complex matching of route parameters.
